gv

ntk will solve your problem when you can't learn and implement,
python tkinter to create desktop application in concern to,
good looking and os level implementation.

gv stands for global variable, which is a file object, we can set attribute to it 
and whenever time we need we can import the gv from ntk and get and set value from this object

simple example:

    ``gv.myname = "John"``

from another file we can import this file object and get attribute value

    ``name = gv.myname`` or we can simply use it by ``gv.myname``
